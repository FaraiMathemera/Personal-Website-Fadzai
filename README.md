1. Install dependencies, run the following commands:

    If `yarn` is not installed, run `npm install` instead.

2. Next, you should create a `.env` file. To do this, run:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

    and set values.

3. Build the react application and serve it with hot module reloading:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
